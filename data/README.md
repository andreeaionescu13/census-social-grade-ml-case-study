# Dataset Information

This project uses a **census-style socio-economic dataset** containing
demographic, household, and lifestyle attributes. The primary target variable
represents an **approximated social grade**, which is used for classification
and related analytical tasks.

Because the dataset was originally provided for academic use, it is **not
included** in this repository.
